# Kosciuszko Train Tracker

## About the Project
The Kosciuszko Train Tracker, developed by Alejandro Diaz, is a Haskell-based application designed specifically for the residents of Brooklyn, particularly those near the Kosciuszko Street station. It provides real-time updates on the J train's arrival times at this station, displayed through an LED screen for community benefit.

## Getting Started
This project is tailored for individuals interested in public transit updates, Haskell programming, and DIY hardware projects.

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of Haskell and functional programming.
- Access to a public transit API for real-time train data.
- LED display hardware for output (optional for initial development stages).

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DiaA6383/kosciuszko-train-tracker.git
   ```
2. Install any necessary Haskell dependencies.

## Usage
Run the application from a command line, or integrate it with an LED display setup. Detailed instructions for both methods will be available in the project documentation.
